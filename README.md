## BINF7700_Capstone_DivyaSharma
This repository contains my course capstone project, where I apply programming and data analysis skills to explore, clean, analyze, and present insights from real-world datasets. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to think analytically, write clean code, and follow a complete data or bioinformatics workflow from raw data to results.

### Technical Skills Inventory
Programming Languages: Python, basic SQL
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Visualization: Matplotlib, basic Tableau
Bioinformatics / Data Handling:

### Working with structured datasets (CSV, TSV)
Command-line basics (CLI, terminal usage)
Writing modular Python scripts

### Software & Tools:
Git & GitHub (repositories, commits, push/pull)

### Core Concepts:

Omics, Genomics, Transcriptomics

### Learning Goals for This Course

By the end of this course, I aim to:
Strengthen my Python, Linux and R programming skills bioinformatics tasks.
Learn how to design clean, well-structured, and reusable code.
Gain confidence using Git and GitHub for version control and project sharing.
Understand how real-world datasets are processed, analyzed, and interpreted.
Improve my ability to document projects clearly using README files and comments.
Build a strong portfolio project suitable for academic and entry-level technical roles.
